Create an interactive heatmap of parking tickets in a region.

## Set-up working environment
#### Using *Intellij IDEA*
1. git clone https://github.com/edavidj/hazardparking.git
2. When Intellij starts up on the *Welcome Screen* select import project.
3. In the following dialogue it will say select file or directory to import, select /src/build.gradle
4. Once *Intellij* finishes building your work environment you should be able to run it by running the Application.java file.
5. Go to localhost:8080 in browser and it should return a massive array of Entry objects.

## Reference
We used
[Spring's "*Working a Getting Started guide with IntelliJ IDEA*"](https://spring.io/guides/gs/intellij-idea/) in order to bootstrap a functional Spring RESTful Web App environment that we could work with, then removed their class files for our own and customized the environment while removing unneeded files.
